# Imgur-testing-with-Nightwatch
End-to-end testing of imgur.com with Nightwatch.js

## Objective
Write a set of automated tests using nightwatch.js to test imgur.com. Include tests of the
following functionality:

• New Post: make sure you can upload an image and that it takes you to that page after

• Search: make sure you can search, and that the results are tied to your query

• “Random Mode” function: test that the random button works and takes you to a new
page without errors.

Include a readme.md explaining your test choices. If any tests fail your expectations,
please note them as well.

Browsers to test: Chrome & Firefox
